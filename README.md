# FYRE Object Detection
This is a super quick and dirty implementation of a floodfill object detection algorithm. It's not perfect, but it's a good starting point for a more robust implementation. The algorithm is based on the floodfill algorithm, which is a simple algorithm that fills in a region of pixels with a specific color. The algorithm works by starting at a seed pixel and then recursively filling in neighboring pixels that are within a certain color threshold. The algorithm is not perfect, but it's a good starting point for a more robust implementation.
